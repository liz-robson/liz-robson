Hi, I'm Liz 👋

👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on my final project before graduating from the School of Code as a full-stack developer

💬 Ask me about how I got here...from dressing film stars in diamonds at the Oscars, to the world of tech 

🙋🏻‍♀️ I’m looking to learn more about prompt engineering

💚 My ultimate aim is to build solutions through tech that create a positive social impact, whether it's big or small
