Hi, I'm Liz 👋

👩🏻‍💻 I have recently graduated from the School of Code Bootcamp 15 as a full-stack developer! See my pinned group projects

💬 Ask me about how I got here...from dressing film stars in diamonds at the Oscars, to the world of tech 

🙋🏻‍♀️ I’m looking to learn more about prompt engineering

💚 I would love to use my new tech skills to build solutions that create a positive social impact, whether it's big or small
